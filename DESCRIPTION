Description: This package takes as an input  a MatLab code. It does some syntax changes, but most of the heavy lifting is in the function changes since the languages are so similar. Options for different data structures and the functions that can be changed are given. At the R code is written and linted. This will not make the code more R-like and may not even run afterwards. However, the rudimentary code changes are done quickly so that the maintainer can focus on changes to the the design structure to make the code more R-thonic or more Rpkg-thonic.
